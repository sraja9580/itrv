	1. Enables functional programing
	2. Readable code in certain scenarios(avoids boiler plate coding)
	3. Supports parallel processing
	
2. FunctionalInterfce
	--A interface with only one abstract method
	--@FunctionalInterfce annotation helps to mark interface as functional interface,it is NOT MANDATORY
		(it helps us not to add additional abstract method by mistake)
	--functional interface is the datatype of lamda expression
