1. Jshell
2. Modularity
3. StreamAPI Enhancements
4. Private Method in interface
5. Factory Methods for Immutable List, Set, Map and Map.Entry

Java 10
	Local variable type inference
	-----------------------------	
		var list = new ArrayList<String>(); // infers ArrayList<String>
		var stream = list.stream();         // infers Stream<String>
		
		List<Actor> actors =  List.of(new Actor()); // Pre Java 10 
		var actors = List.of(new Actor()); // Java 10 onwards 
	
	Collector API Enhancements (unmodifiableList)
	--------------------------
	empList.stream().filter(emp.getName().contain("RA")).collect(Collectors.unmodifiableList);
	
	Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices
	---------------------------------------------
	Applications have become memory hungry, thereâ€™s an increase in cloud-native applications, in-memory databases, streaming applications.
	In order to cater to these services, there are various memory architectures available. This feature enhances the capability of
	HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object heap on an alternative memory device, such as an NV-DIMM, specified by the user.

	This JEP targets alternative memory devices that have the same semantics as DRAM, including the semantics of atomic operations
	, and can, therefore, be used instead of DRAM for the object heap without any change to existing application code.

Java 11
	1. Running java class in single command
		-- javac Exaple.java not required
		-- java Exaple.java it implicitly compiles.
		
	2.  New utility method in String 
		isBlank()
		strip(),stripLeading(),stripTrail()
		strip() -> removes Unicode empty space also which trim wont 
		
	3. File API update for read & write string
