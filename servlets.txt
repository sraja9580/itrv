RequestDispatcher
	RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("servlet2");  
	//servlet2 is the url-pattern of the second servlet   
	rd.forward(request, response);//method may be include or forward 
	
SingleThreadModel ?
	hat no two threads will execute concurrently in the servlet’s service method
	SingleThreadModel does not solve all thread-safety issues. For example, session attributes and static variables can still be 
		accessed by multiple requests on multiple threads at the same time
	interface is Deprecated in Servlet 2.4.
	
Are Servlets Thread Safe? How to achieve thread-safety in servlets?
	int & destroy yes
	do get and do post not
	
What is URL Encoding?
	URL Encoding is the process of converting data into CGI form so that it can travel across the network without any issues. 
	URL Encoding strips the white spaces and replaces special characters with escape characters. 
	We can use java.net.URLEncoder.encode(String str, String unicode) to encode a String. 
	URL Decoding is the reverse process of encoding and we can use java.net.URLDecoder.decode(String str, String unicode) 
			to decode the encoded string. For example “Pankaj’s Data” is encoded to “Pankaj%27s+Data”.
