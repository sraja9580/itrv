Design Patterns:
----------------
	Coupling -> loose coupling using interface
	Encapsulation ->

	Creational
	----------
		different ways to create object
		
	Factory -> hides object creation logic from client
			-> The Factory pattern also known as Virtual Constructor
			
	Abstract Factory -> Factory of Factory
	
	Singleton 
	
	Prototype -> Returning clone of object
	
	Builder Design Pattern:
		Building complex object step by step
	
	Structural patterns
	-------------------
		relationship between objects
		
		
	Behavioral patterns
	-------------------
		interaction or communication between objects
		Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
		behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.
		
		-> Template method design pattern.
		Memento Design Pattern
		----------------------
			The Memento Design Pattern offers a solution to implement undoable actions
			We can do this by saving the state of an object at a given instant and restoring it if the actions performed since need to be undone.
		
		Originator - Object whose state need to be saved.
		Caretaker -  is the object triggering the save and restore of the state, which is called the Memento
		Memento -    the object that is going to maintain the state of originator. Its just a POJO. It is replica class that holds info originator which need to be saved and restored.
