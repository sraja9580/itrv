Having vs WHERE
	A WHERE clause is used is filter records from a result.  The filter occurs before any groupings are made.
	A HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group.
	
	SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
	INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
	WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
	GROUP BY LastName
	HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;

Clustered Index:
	The clustered index is used to reorder the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. 
	Each table can have only one clustered index. The Clustered index is the only index which has been automatically created '
		when the primary key is generated.
	If moderate data modification needed to be done in the table then clustered indexes are preferred.
	
Non-Clustered Index:
	The reason to create non-clustered index is searching the data. We well know that clustered indexes are created 
		automatically primary keys are generated, but non-clustered indexes are created when multiple joins conditions and
		various filters are used in the query. Non-Clustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains 
		logical order of data.
		
	Each table can have 999 non-clustered indexes.
